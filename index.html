        Autumn, also known as fall in American and Canadian English,
            <small>
                    [1]
            </small> 
        is one of the four temperate seasons. 
        Autumn marks the transition from summer to winter, in September 
        (Northern Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere), when the 
        duration of daylight becomes noticeably shorter and the temperature 
        cools down considerably. One of its main features is the shedding of 
        leaves from deciduous trees.
        <br>
        Some cultures regard the autumnal equinox as "mid-autumn", 
        while others with a longer temperature lag treat it as the start 
        of autumn.

        autumn is usually considered to start with the 
        September equinox (21 to 24 September)

        solstice (21 or 22 December).

        Popular culture in North America 
        associates Labor Day, the first Monday in September, as the end of 
        summer and the start of autumn; certain summer traditions, such 
        as wearing white, are discouraged after that date.

        As daytime 
        and nighttime temperatures decrease, trees shed their leaves.

        meteorological service, Met Ã‰ireann, are September, October 
        and November.

        However,according to the Irish Calendar, 
        which is based on ancient Gaelic traditions, autumn lasts throughout 
        the months of August, September and October, or possibly a few days 
        later, depending on tradition[citation needed].

            Although colour change in leaves occurs wherever 
            deciduous trees are found, coloured autumn foliage is noted in 
            various regions of the world: most of North America, Eastern Asia 
            <em>
                (including China, Korea, and Japan)
            </em>
            , Europe, the forest of 
            Patagonia, eastern Australia and New Zealand's South Island.
            Eastern Canada and New England are famous for their autumnal 
            foliage,[23][24] and this attracts major tourism (worth billions 
            of US dollars) for the regions.
