            <br>Autumn, also known as fall in American and Canadian English,
            [1] is one of the four temperate seasons. 
            Autumn marks the transition from summer to winter, in September 
            (Northern Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere), when the 
            duration of daylight becomes noticeably shorter and the temperature 
            cools down considerably. One of its main features is the shedding of 
            leaves from deciduous trees.
        
            Some cultures regard the autumnal equinox as "mid-autumn", 
            while others with a longer temperature lag treat it as the start 
            of autumn.[2]Meteorologists (and most of the temperate countries 
            in the southern hemisphere)[3] use a definition based on months, 
            with autumn being September, October and November 
            in the northern hemisphere,[4] and March, April and May in the 
            southern hemisphere.
            
            <br>In North America, autumn is usually considered to start with the 
            September equinox (21 to 24 September)[5] and end with the winter 
            solstice (21 or 22 December).[6] Popular culture in North America 
            associates Labor Day, the first Monday in September, as the end of 
            summer and the start of autumn; certain summer traditions, such 
            as wearing white, are discouraged after that date.[7] As daytime 
            and nighttime temperatures decrease, trees shed their leaves.[8] 
            <br>In traditional East Asian solar 
            term, autumn starts on or around 8 August and ends on or about 
            7 November.
            <br>In Ireland, the autumn months according to the national 
            meteorological service, Met Ã‰ireann, are September, 
            October and November.[9] However,according to the Irish Calendar, 
            which is based on ancient Gaelic traditions, autumn lasts throughout 
            the months of August, September and October, or possibly a few days 
            later, depending on tradition[citation needed]. 
            <br>In Australia and New Zealand, autumn officially begins on 
            1 March and ends on 31 May.[10]
